# pre-cache

Generated text files from ImageSetConfiguration.

Can try out install using either version if the pre-cache disk is large enough. Current config's take up this much space:

```bash
Filesystem                        Size  Used Avail Use%
/dev/sda1                         298G  150G  149G  51%
```

Copy the set of *.txt files to disk when choosing which version to install.
